# game-off-2021-beerunner
My submission for the Game Off 2021 gamejam.

Bee Runner aims to be a endless runner fixed on curves. You controll a bee and need to pick up resources and avoid hazards. If I have time left I want to use the bee's stinger to create a shooting mechanism.

Just after implementing normals and UV's on the track mesh
